## The Execution Firewall for Autonomous Agents

> AI can reason.
> But when it tries to act, someone should be watching.

SafetyClawz is an open-source execution firewall that sits between AI systems and the real world.

It doesn’t change what your agent thinks.

It controls what your agent is allowed to do.

# README Opening (Provocative, Broad Appeal)

Modern AI can:

* Send emails
* Access files
* Modify databases
* Trigger payments
* Move robots
* Call APIs
* Execute shell commands

But most agent frameworks assume that once a tool is called, it should run.

That’s a dangerous assumption.

SafetyClawz makes every action earn the right to execute.

Before an AI system touches the outside world, SafetyClawz evaluates:

* Risk
* Context
* Sensitivity
* Confidence
* Policy rules

And decides:

* ✅ Approve
* ⏳ Require approval
* 🧪 Simulate
* 🛑 Block

If AI is going to act, it needs a firewall.

# Why This Resonates Beyond Developers

This isn’t just about code.

It’s about:

* Preventing accidental emails
* Preventing financial mistakes
* Preventing rogue automation
* Preventing unsafe robotic movement
* Preventing hallucinated authority

Non-technical framing:

> We don’t let websites run without firewalls.
>
> Why are we letting autonomous systems run without one?

That line lands.

# Homepage / Landing Page Version

Big headline:

> AI that acts needs boundaries.

Subtext:

> SafetyClawz is the open execution firewall for autonomous systems.

Three simple pillars:

🔐 Intercept
🧠 Evaluate
🛑 Enforce

No jargon.

# How It Works (Readable by Anyone)

1. Your AI wants to do something.
2. SafetyClawz checks how risky that action is.
3. It applies your rules.
4. It either lets it happen, pauses it, or blocks it.
5. Everything is logged.

Simple.

# Tone Strategy

We avoid:

* “Alignment” buzzwords
* Academic framing
* Over-technical jargon
* Corporate compliance language

We use:

* “Real-world”
* “Actions”
* “Boundaries”
* “Firewalls”
* “Control”
